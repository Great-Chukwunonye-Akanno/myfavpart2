    <p>In my free time on weekend when I am done my homework, I do online gaming. Online gaming is a video game that is either partially or primarily played through the Internet or any other computer network available.[1] Online games are ubiquitous on modern gaming platforms, including PCs, consoles and mobile devices, and span many genres, including first-person shooters, strategy games, and massively multiplayer online role-playing games. The games that I have is Subway Surfers, Among Us, Genshin Impact, City Car Driving Stunt Master and Burnout Drift Hilltop. There are others gaming you can play online that is on Google Play, App Store, Windows and more.</p>
